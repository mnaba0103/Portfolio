  <h2> About Me </h2>
  <p> Hi fans! Just incase you haven't been stalking me as much lately, I am a 16 year old girl from Great Neck, New York. 
    I like coding, business, watching tv, baking, and of course hummus! 
    I don't dislike much but if you really want to know my pet peaves, I really dislike when people are when people procrastinate... 
    If you are interested in hearing a fun fact about me I am intolerant to practically every one of your favorite foods including dairy, gluten, eggs, soy, and a lot more!
  Some of my favorite links include the following:
