  <h4> Likes, Dislikes, Fun Facts, etc. </h4>
  <p> Hi fans! Just incase you haven't been stalking me as much lately, I am a 16 year old girl from Great Neck, New York.<hr>
    
  I like coding, business, watching tv, baking, and of course hummus!
    
  I don't dislike much but if you really want to know my pet peaves, I really dislike when people are when people procrastinate... 
    
  If you are interested in hearing a fun fact about me I am intolerant to practically every one of your favorite foods including dairy, gluten, eggs, soy, and a lot more!
  
  Some of my favorite links include the following:
    
  <a href="netflix.com">Netflix</a> and
    <a href=decadirect.com>DECA Direct</a>
